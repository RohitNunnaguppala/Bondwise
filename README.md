## Project Overview

**Bondwise** is a MERN-stack mentorship platform built by Rohit to help juniors connect with seniors across institutions. It enables real-time chats, Q&A forums, and community interactions ‚Äî all moderated through AI-based content filtering and secured using context-aware authentication.

### üîê Context-Aware Security

Bondwise collects contextual data like device info, location, and IP address to fingerprint user sessions. This data is encrypted using AES and securely stored. Suspicious logins trigger OTP verification to prevent unauthorized access.

### üß† AI-Based Content Moderation

To ensure a safe and respectful environment, Bondwise integrates a flexible AI moderation pipeline with:

- **Perspective API** ‚Äì Detects toxicity, harassment, and spam.
- **Hugging Face BART-MNLI** ‚Äì Used for zero-shot classification of post content.
- **TextRazor** (optional) ‚Äì Adds semantic understanding and category tagging.

A unified Flask-based interface handles these services modularly, allowing easy integration and switching.

### üë• User Roles

Bondwise supports three user roles with defined responsibilities:

- **Admin** ‚Äì Controls platform configuration, community rules, and moderator assignments.
- **Moderators** ‚Äì Manage flagged content, oversee discussions, and ensure community guidelines.
- **General Users** ‚Äì Ask questions, mentor others, chat, and participate in forum discussions.
